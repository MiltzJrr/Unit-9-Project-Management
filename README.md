# Unit-9-Project-Management

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
1. This project is from my work in BTEC IT Extended Diploma. This is the actual work that I submitted for my grade (in past) and I am happy for anyone to use it for their own projects and/or proof of work I can do and have done.

2. Some files may not be working, this is because of how they were created. This would be because the file paths are outdated or they created on a certain program or application.

Terms & Conditions!

1.a. The use of this code or any code that is found under 'Miltzjrr/' on GitHub.com is completely at your own risk and I am not responsible for any issues that arrise because using any of my work means that you are abiding by the following Terms and Conditions.
  1.b. Code can be changed by me at any time, but this does not prevent the fact that this work (all /Unit-'n'-) was submitted to the exam board when/after it was due. 
  1.c. Some of the work that is uploaded may not be up-to-date and therefore would not be a good way to structure your evaluations or explanaitions on certain criteria. For example, in my Unit 6 Assignment 1, I did not understand the Typography sector clearly and therefore wrote about the wrong information or did not include enough information. *if you are feeling the same way about a certain charteristic or sector please inform your lecturer, teacher or project manager as they may be more help than I could be.
  
2.a. Please note that following a similar pattern as I have in some of my work may not award you a similar grade since all exam boards or workplaces have a different preference and standard of how certain work is completed and by following the structures and language I have used might not award you similarly.
  2.b. Some files may not be working, this is because of how they were created. Therefore it would be a good idea to recreate the files using your own directories and then test them. 

3.a. I am more than happy for you to use any references or sources I have left in the files in order for you to write assignments, however, please make sure you note the T&Cs when doing so. 
  3.b. Not all sources may be appropriate for you to use, please make sure you use the correct and appropriate sources as well as noting where you got them from. For example, if you used any of my content in an assignment and are required to list sources, make sure that you do.
